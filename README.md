# GraphicCalculator-
Features:
-graphically
    -empty label to display the math
    -buttons for the numbers, operations, enter, and clear
    -can type the numbers with either pressing the buttons or keypresses (this would use if statements)
-save and display history
    -maybe a scroll-up history box as a feature we didn't learn in class
    -maybe run by a for loop, all the operations could be kept within a list and then run through and printed (coud also be a class object that has two attributes which are the operation and then the associated value)
    -has a clear button to clear history
-color theme
    -create a couple color themes (maybe just dark and light mode) so that the user can choose which theme (like pressing a button which pops up the options and then choosing one) (couls use classes here potentially as well)
-it also could include an image in the corner as something we have not learned
